## About this project

This [project](https://atu-main-mdl-euwest1.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/66/82/6682ae48f67ebab9c769ddae345221f3d6405bfe?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22Project%202024.pdf%22&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAWRN6GJFLWCMOG6H7%2F20240503%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240503T150953Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=21547&X-Amz-Signature=acbfbd441db6e3cd56ef3e3b9fcc1c2b1921963e00667cebf1c714bd8cd504a6) for the Programming and Scripting module is my analysis on the widely available [Iris flower data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set#cite_note-anderson35-3).

Upon execution of the code, it will generate the following outputs:

    The code will compile the items into a text file named "summary.txt."
    The graphical representations corresponding to items 2 and 3 will be saved as .png image files.

We will use the outputs to explore and demonstrate the following items:

# 1. Dataset properties
* Species & count
* Variables
* Statistical description of dataset
* Data types

# 2. Graphical representation of data in a histogram
* Petal length 
* Petal width
* Sepal length
* Sepal width

# 3. tba
* tba
* tba
* tba



Let's explore the items in 1:
First of all I have chosen to display the data in its entirety as opposed to truncated. It requires a bit of scrolling down in the text file but it's still reasonable as there are a total of 150 lines only which translates to 150 samples taken. We now learn that 50 samples were taken from three different flower species each: Setosa, Versicolor & Virginica. Next we see the stastical description of the data set: Count, mean, standard deviation, min & max (minimum & maximum value observed for each feature), 25%, 50, & 75% percentile, hence first quartile, which is the value below which 25% of the observations fall, median half of the observation fall below and half above that value and last third quartile, which is the value below which 75% of the observations fall.
